# Lame CLI Programs

Small python cli programs that are not big enough to need their own repo, but at the same time I want
to be installable into a typical UNIX OS.

* `vaultauth` : Script that returns a fresh vault token

## Mac OS
For the lesser Unix users who sometimes struggle a bit. Trouble running these scripts once installed? Try adding the following directory to your `$PATH`.
```
/Users/<you>/Library/Python/3.6/bin
```
